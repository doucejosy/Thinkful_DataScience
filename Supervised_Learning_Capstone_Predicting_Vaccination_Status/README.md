# Predicting Children Vaccination Status in the US
This project uses predictive analytics algorithms to identify children aged 19 through 35 months who are likely to default on their routine immunization schedule in the US. I addressed the following questions to gain more insight on the problem:


1. What are the socio-economic and demographic characteristics of children not up-to-date with their vaccines?
2. Which states have the highest percentage of unvaccinated children?

### Methods Explored
- Logistic Regression
- KNN
- Randomg Forest
- Light Gradient Boosting Machine

### Technologies/Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scipy
- Sklearn
- Imbalanced-learn

I used additional resampling techniques to address class imbalance in order to improve performance metrics.
